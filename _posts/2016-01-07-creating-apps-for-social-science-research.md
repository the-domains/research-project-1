**CREATING APPS FOR SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH**

The continued decline in survey response rates has reinvigorated critics who argue that this research method does not capture the complexity of most social processes. Meanwhile, the rise of social media has produced an unprecedented wealth of qualitative data that provide rich, longitudinal detail about social relationships as they unfold. Unfortunately, such "[_big data_][0]" is neither representative nor reliable. I present Social Media Research Apps as a new tool that combines the strengths of big data and survey research. This new tool, 

* Systematically extracts large amounts of data from a large number of social media users; 
* Asks such users a series of questions which enable researchers to place their online behavior in broader context; 
* Returns analysis of these data back to the user to create incentive for public participation in social science research. ![](https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/23de10910196cd30a7187bb811cc1c24/passthrough.jpg?height=199&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F752f06332f852c60570e7e1045df1fc9480e6d22.jpg&width=200)

I illustrate this methodology via an app that collected 192 variables that describe how more than 123 million Facebook users interacted with 9,911 messages produced by a large group of organ donation advocacy groups across 1.4 years. I conclude by discussing how apps improve the scope, scalability, sampling, cost, efficiency, public relevance, and convenience of conventional survey research but also highlight new technical, logistical, and legal challenges in implementing this new methodology.

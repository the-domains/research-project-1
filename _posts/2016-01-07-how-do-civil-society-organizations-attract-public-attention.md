Though many studies explain how advocacy groups raise funds and shape the policy process, very little is known about how they raise awareness about social problems among the broader public. This article suggests groups that produce emotional messages are more likely to secure public attention and that emotional reactions to such messages create a feedback effect that increases the number of people they reach over time. To evaluate this theory, this study employs a Facebook "app" that collects detailed information about the interaction between forty-seven advocacy groups that seek to raise awareness about the lack of organ and tissue donors in the United States and more than 123 million Facebook users. Negative binomial regression models provide strong evidence for the theory of emotional feedback---even after controls are introduced for organizational capacity and tactics, demographic characteristics of their audiences, and various indicators of public interest in organ donation at the state and local level.
